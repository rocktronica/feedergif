WiP to send me GIFs of my cat eating food when I'm not around

![Hey bud](http://mynameistommy.com/feedergif/1451099276.gif)

## Bugs

- gif halts on empty or corrupt photos
- pi can run out of space causing curl error 23
- if light switch is off, lights won't turn on
- starting script immediately into active timer should delete preexisting photos

## Needs

- move all settings into cli arguments
